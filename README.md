# Sarcasm Detection using NLP

This project implements a **Sarcasm Detection** model using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to classify whether a given sentence is sarcastic or not, based on its content.

## 📝 Project Description

Sarcasm detection is a challenging problem in NLP due to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of sarcasm. This project leverages **Word2Vec** embeddings and machine learning models to classify text data for sarcasm.

The dataset used consists of headlines labeled as sarcastic or not sarcastic, commonly used for benchmark NLP tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- Data Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopword Removal)
- Word Embeddings using **Word2Vec (Gensim)**
- Machine Learning Model for classification
- Model Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualization of results
